    The inspiration behind this project is based on a series of immuaculate blog posts made by the incredibly gifted and talented [Bartosz Ciechenawski](https://ciechanow.ski/). His blog posts are interactive in nature - allowing the readers to walk through his explanation of complex topics with interactive examples to better comprehend the content.

    My personal favorite post of his is on [Sound](https://ciechanow.ski/sound/). Check it out - it's well worth the read.

    Another reason behind my creating this project is that the [current most popular offering](https://www.craftofexile.com/en/) for Path of Exile crafting emulation and simulation is closed source (as far as I can see).

    This project will hopefully provide the community with a much better way to guide themselves through the more complex crafts using a fully open-sourced and open-for-collaboration ecosystem.

## Project Milestones

_Note: These milestones are dynamic in nature. They'll change (a lot) during the early stages of the project - both in their essence and priority._

1. Crafting emulator for 'basic' items (i.e. non-influenced, non-special bases (e.g. delve), non-league-specfic crafting)
1. Crafting emulator support for 'advanced' items
1. Crafting simulation support for calculating average attempts for single-step crafting outcomes
1. Expand simulation to support to multi-step crafting outcomes
1. Crafting blogs with integrated emulation (this will include support for item start states and limited crafting options (e.g. only allowed to use scours and alchemy orbs - think [Guff Betrayal crafting](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Guff_%22Tiny%22_Grenn#Position_/_Currency)))
1. Integration with pricing provided by [poe.ninja](https://poe.ninja/economy/settlers/currency)
