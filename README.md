## Foreword

The inspiration behind this project is based on a series of immuaculate blog posts made by the incredibly gifted and talented [Bartosz Ciechenawski](https://ciechanow.ski/). His blog posts are interactive in nature - allowing the readers to walk through his explanation of complex topics with interactive examples to better comprehend the content.

My personal favorite post of his is on [Sound](https://ciechanow.ski/sound/). Check it out - it's well worth the read.

Another reason behind my creating this project is that the [current most popular offering](https://www.craftofexile.com/en/) for Path of Exile crafting emulation and simulation is closed source (as far as I can see).

This project will hopefully provide the community with a much better way to guide themselves through the more complex crafts using a fully open-sourced and open-for-collaboration ecosystem.

## Project Milestones

_Note: These milestones are dynamic in nature. They'll change (a lot) during the early stages of the project - both in their essence and priority._

1. Crafting emulator for 'basic' items (i.e. non-influenced, non-special bases (e.g. delve), non-league-specfic crafting)
1. Crafting emulator support for 'advanced' items
1. Crafting blogs with integrated emulation (this will include support for item start states and limited crafting options (e.g. only allowed to use scours and alchemy orbs - think [Guff Betrayal crafting](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Guff_%22Tiny%22_Grenn#Position_/_Currency)))
1. Integration with pricing provided by [poe.ninja](https://poe.ninja/economy/settlers/currency)
